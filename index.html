							<h2><strong>Game Programming & Data Sience</strong></h2>
							<p>
								I have been playing videogames my whole life. Before I enrolled university, I decided that my purpose in life would be making games, so that I could share the breathtaking emotions I've felt while playing. Therefore, I started learning Unity and have used it since. I am a really curious and passionate person, who loves acquiring all kind of knowledge and skills, specially those related with programming or videogames.
